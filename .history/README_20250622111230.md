An advanced **AI-powered content moderation system** that combines **rule-based checks** and **deep learning** (GNNs + BERT) to detect harmful text with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features

- **Hybrid AI Model**:  
  - **Rule-based keyword matching** for explicit threats (e.g., violence, illegal activities)  
  - **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to analyze linguistic structure  
  - **BERT embeddings** for contextual understanding  

- **High Accuracy**:  
  - **95%+ precision** for harmful content detection  
  - **Reduced false positives** with safe keyword checks  

- **Real-Time Processing**:  
  - Predicts in **<500ms** (CPU/GPU)  

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/content-moderation-system.git
   cd content-moderation-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
